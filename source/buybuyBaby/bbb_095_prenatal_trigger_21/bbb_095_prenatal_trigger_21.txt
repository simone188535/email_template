Potty Training
Typically, interested begins between 18 and 36 months. You’ll want to keep a potty seat accessible so you’ll be ready the minute they are. Let your toddler observe you or your family members going to the bathroom. And most importantly, keep a sense of humor about this whole topic.
Helpful products: potty chairs, step stools, potty books, disposable potty covers (for on-the-go), and a travel potty (to keep in the car).

Sleepy time
Typically, the shift to a toddler bed will happen around 2-3 years. Build excitement for your child's new bed, but keep it in the same place as the crib for familiarity. Celebrate the move with fun bedding!
Helpful products: toddler beds, bedrails, toddler pillow, and bedding.

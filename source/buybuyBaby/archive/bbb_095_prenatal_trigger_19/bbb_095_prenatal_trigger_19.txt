  Musical toy instruments, sing–along toys

* Likes to dump out containers 
  Shape sorters

* Explores through pretend play 
  Playsets, rocking horse, simple dress-up

* Understands instructions 
  Simple puzzles

* Scribbles 
  Washable crayons, chalk

* Points to and names common objects, animals, and characters 
  Picture story book

* Walks without assistance 
  Push or pull toys

Don't worry, this won't last forever
---------------------------------------

It’s hard on everyone when your baby is fussy. But don’t worry, colic shows up in many babies around this time and is generally defined by crying for more than 3 hours in a row on 3 or more days a week for at least 3 weeks. Colic isn’t an illness and it won’t cause your baby any long-term harm. Here are some ideas that help.

Try a new bottle.
Several bottles are designed to reduce the colic-inducing air your baby ingests. 
Feed your baby upright.

Feeding your baby in an upright position can also help reduce air intake. Keep baby upright for at least five minutes after feeding.

Create a soothing environment.
Soft, tranquil music or white noise and swaddling can help your baby fall asleep and 

Try a warm bath.
A warm bath can soothe and distract your baby. 

Everyone loves a tummy rub.
Gentle massaging or bicycling your baby’s legs can help release trapped gas from your baby’s stomach. 

Side holding.
Try holding your baby as if you’re about to breastfeed, but facing out.

Check your own diet.
If you’re breastfeeding, slight changes in your diet could help. Try to avoid spicy foods, dairy, chocolate and other gassy foods. 

Try a swing.
The motion is often enough to calm babies and help them fall asleep. 

Offer pacifiers or your breast
This meets a need some babies have to suck more often than during feedings.

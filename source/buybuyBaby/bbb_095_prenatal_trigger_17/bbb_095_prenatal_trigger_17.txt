Selecting the best toys for your baby

The most important ingredient in stimulating development is the interaction between parent and baby. With the help of a variety of developmental toys, you can help strengthen your baby’s confidence and inspire curiosity.

* Beginning to walk with assistance
  Activity tables and walk-behind toys are great confidence boosters.

* Tossing things from hands, placing toys in a box 
  Plush sports toys or nesting cups.

* Imitating parent
  They’ll love pretend toys such as cell phones or remotes.

* Speaking first words
  Encourage them with toys that have interactive words or sounds.

* More controlled movement
  Offer finger paints, toys with buttons or stacking rings.

* Anticipating response 
  They’ll love toys with surprise action.

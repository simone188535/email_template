Your baby's first winder
Cooler weather is great for cuddling with your baby. But it can also mean lots of runny noses and chapped skin. With a few simple preparations, your baby will stay warm and lovey all winter long.

Dealing with cold weather 
Dress your baby in one more layer than you're wearing (babies can't regulate body temps as well as you can). Keep your baby's head and ears covered and use mittens, warm shoes, and socks to keep toesies warm. Always have a blanket nearby and use a sling or other carrier so you can cuddle for shared warmth.
Helpful products: jackets, vests or bunting, hats, mittens, and stroller blankets

Staying healthy and comfy 
Avoid exposing sensitive skin to sun and wind. Keep baths to a minimum (soap and water can be very drying). A dab of lanolin, or even breast milk, will treat chapped lips. Winter sun can be as brutal as in the summer – use sunscreen on bright days.
No one wants to be wet in the winter. From leaky diapers to snow or sweat, it's important to have extra outfits (and diapers) on hand. Keep your home thermostat between 68° and 72°F. Make it a bit warmer during bath time.
Helpful products: humidifiers, nasal aspirators, healing ointments, moisturizers, sunscreen, thermometers, saline nose drops, and wipes.

Where has the time gone?
This is a time to celebrate all the ways your baby (and you) have grown and developed over the past year. Whether you are planning a low-key celebration or a large party, here are some tips to make the day more memorable

* Begin with the basics 
  Who and what will make the occasion feel most special? Remember, you will be caring for your little one during the party so keep your guest list manageable.

* Rested babies are happy babies 
  The most important guest of the day is your baby, so plan the time around your baby's nap time.

* Activites 
  One-year-olds play near each other more than with each other. So, toys in a safe play area are a better idea than group activities. Loud noises from party poppers or bursting balloons may frighten your baby, and discarded poppers and balloons are a choking hazard. Think about some musical fun instead, like dancing with your baby.

* Mark the moment 
  Charge up the batteries and enlist someone to help take pictures. Many buybuy BABY® stores have portrait studios where you can capture this milestone with professional portraits as well. Consider a special frame for your portrait or an outfit to mark this momentous occasion

* Invitations 
  Your 1st birthday invitations should be just as special as your baby's first year. Whether print or digital, choose an invitation based on some of your baby's favorite things.

* Short and sweet 
  All this attention may be very overwhelming for your baby. 1-1.5 hours is max for most babies.

* Food 
  Finger foods are great to keep the party groove going. Milk and fruit juices are great for kids. And two cakes! One for eating and one for smashing. Be careful of nuts and small candies which can cause choking hazards.

* Enjoy! 
  Pat yourself on the back for a year as rewarding and as challenging (if not more!) as anything you have ever done before. Take a moment to soak it all in and enjoy with your baby.

For your baby's safety, keep them in the back seat facing rear as long as possible. 
Facing rear provides more protection to their neck and spine in the event of a crash.

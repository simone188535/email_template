Your baby first summer
Your baby’s first summer means lots of fun for the family and lots of firsts for your baby. With a few simple preparations, everyone will keep giggling through those long summer days.

Stay save in the sun
Babies under 6 months should avoid direct sunlight. Cover as much area as possible with clothes, hats, and umbrellas. For babies over 6 months, use sunscreen made for babies. Broad-spectrum sunscreen is best; it will block both UVA and UVB rays. Slather it on at least every two hours or after swimming or sweating. And don’t forget to protect your baby's eyes with those adorable sunglasses. 
Helpful products: sunscreen, sundome, hats and sunglasses.

Keep cool in the heat 
Babies are sensitive to heat stroke and should stay in the shade and cool as much as possible. Baby pools are great for cooling down (ALWAYS keep watch on your baby). Give your baby plenty of fluids and watch for signs of dehydration such as no tears, dry mouth and skin, less activity, muscle weakness or decreased urine. 
Helpful products: baby pools, car seat sun covers and stroller sunshade.

Keep watch 
Be sure to fence off any area with pesticides or poisonous plants (babies will put anything in their mouths). Install window guards in any room where your baby may be playing. And watch for mosquitoes and other insects— bug repellent if they’re over 2 months and netting if they’re under 2 months. Helpful products: outdoor safety signs, driveway guards, stroller netting and bug repellant.

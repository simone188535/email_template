  img_alt: 'MEET THE BALDUCCI&#39;S CALIFORNIA COLLECTION. We&#39;re proud to introduce perhaps the finest examples of California varietals we&#39;ve ever been able to secure. Wine is available at Balducci&#39;s Alexandria, Bethesda, Greenwich, McLean and Reston locations. CABERNET SAUVIGNON Full of lively plum flavors with oak highlights on the mid-palate and a finish with vanilla and toasty notes. PAIRING: The tannin structure makes this a great pairing with well-marbled cuts like Prime Ribeye. CHARDONNAY A crisp wine with a citrus backbone and rich tropical flair, featuring notes of delicate pear, bright apple and a creamy finish.  PAIRING: We love this citrusy wine with simply prepared foods like baked halibut or lobster.'

  img_alt: 'RED BLEND Offering aromas of Royal cherries, cedar, blueberries, plum pits, dark chocolate and hints of herbs. The palate is full-bodied and brightly flavored with loads of fruit. PAIRING:  The low tannins make this a great pairing for lean cuts like filet mignon. SAUVIGNON BLANC Medium-bodied with a round, juicy texture, the palate presents pear, peach and fresh, tart apple flavors with a lingering, bright finish. PAIRING: Try with oysters, light fish like sole, herbal, briny sauces and anything goat cheese related. PINOT NOIR A lushly styled &#34;bigger&#34; flavored Pinot with a nose of bright red fruit and earth and a full-bodied palate of dark berries and soft tannin. PAIRING: Pinot Noir goes with everything! Try with duck or game birds, casseroles and, of course, beef bourguignon.'

  img_alt: "&#34;I&#39;ve assembled an extraordinary collection of my favorites, just for you.&#34; John Coleman Kings Wine and Cheese Buyer What&#39;s one of the most ancient foods known to mankind? If you said cheese (because you&#39;re a genius who didn’t look at the subject line), you&#39;re right. Though humble in origin, there&#39;s more to cheese than meets the eye – and palate. Cheese is a window into history, terroir, personal expression, and much more. As the Kings Wine and Cheese buyer and Guilde Internationale des Fromagers New World Chapter inductee, I&#39;m passionate about cheese. I&#39;m excited for our upcoming Fall Tasting, with a curated selection of cheeses by yours truly. Here are a few of my seasonal favorites – and I know they&#39;ll be yours, too.* Speaking of ancient foods, the Wrangeback is the oldest known Swedish cheese: it was created by monks in Almnäs Bruk, near Lake Vättern in 1225! Resurrected in 2008, the production levels remain small on this raw cow&#39;s milk cheese, but it is one of my favorites among the new wave of Alpine-style cheeses. While fall officially started on September 23, it&#39;s not fall to me until the first wheels of Oregon&#39;s legendary Rogue River Blue, made with organic cow milk, lands in our stores. I love the mysticism of tying a cheese production to the Autumnal Equinox and embracing the use of local Syrah grape leaves and local Clear Creek pear brandy as inspired ingredients. Fall also signifies truffle season, and the beautifully aged, Sardinian Moliterno Al Tarfuto, mapped with thick veins of Italian black truffles, will make any guest say &#34;wow!&#34;– it&#39;s a standout on any cheese plate. I love it paired with Acacia honey and your favorite Pinot or red Burgundy. Pecorino Romano Fulvi is in a class of its own! Made from 100% sheep&#39;s milk (aged from 10-12 months), this is the only Pecorino Romano still made outside of Rome, in Nepi. It&#39;s a must-try with our Casa Forcello Crab Apple Mostarda. Always imitated, never duplicated. Referred to as the &#34;King of Cheeses&#34;, Parmigiano Reggiano&#39;s nine centuries of history has produced a remarkable cheese that&#39;s highly sought after (and highly protected). Parmigiano Reggiano has more umami (read: deliciousness) than almost any other cheese. Here&#39;s a tip: don&#39;t throw the rind away. It&#39;s a great flavor booster for soups and stocks. We&#39;ll also have cheesemakers from local New Jersey&#39;s Valley Shepherd Creamery and New York&#39;s Beecher&#39;s Handmade at select stores. Looking forward to seeing you on October 26th and November 2 from 12 – 4pm.

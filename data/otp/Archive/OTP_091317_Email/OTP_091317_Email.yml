We are fortunate to have such loyal customers, and they depend on our stores to replace their basic home essentials such as linens, storage & organization, cleaning supplies, rugs and furniture. We are currently working with local relief organizations to make donations and provide relief where needed.  We ask that you join us in assisting the rebuilding efforts though your kind and generous donations. To assist, we have a list of charitable organizations to consider on our website.'
